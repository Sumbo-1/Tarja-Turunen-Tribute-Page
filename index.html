    <h1>Who is this girl?</h1>
    <p>For people who like heavy-metal, name Tarja Turunen is already well known. However, to many music lovers it might be yet a totally new name. So let me introduce you Tarja Turunen – a beautiful woman both outside and inside with stunning classical voice. </p>
    <p>Tarja Turunen comes from Finland, but her voice is loved by people all around the world. Tarja’s style is a mix of symphonic metal and classical music. Imagine powerful rock guitars with a breath-taking female classical voice and an orchestra to deepen the atmosphere, this is exactly how Tarja’s songs sound like. Tarja had been the first vocalist with classical background engaged in symphony metal and later became an inspiration for other female vocalists in metal scene.</p>
    <p>I discovered her amazing voice in 2005 when after splitting up with band Nightwish, where Tarja had been a vocalist for 9 years; she pursued her long term dream and became a solo artist. It took Tarja and her new team two years to put material together and record her first solo album “My Winter Storm”, which came out at the end of 2007. The album had quite a dark mood, though it attracted listeners with its strong theatrical and dramatic concept. Album had a good reception and was highly rated by the critiques. “My Winter Storm” became double platinum in Russia, platinum in Finland and golden in Germany and Czech Republic.</p>
    <p>As a big compliment to Tarja’s voice and beautiful orchestral arrangements are the lyrics of her songs. Tarja likes her listeners to find their own meaning in every song of her. Some of the lyrics in her songs are implicit and have a fantasy theme, whereas others are more explicit and reflect upon Tarja’s personal experiences in life.</p>
    <p>Tarja’s voice and music are truly magical. So many times it helped me to survive through the darkest moments of my life. I’m very grateful for the day I discovered this very talented lady and I’m honoured to be leaving in the days of Tarja Turunen and her fantastic music.</p>
